# How to Get A Free Key

<Warning>
  Before starting - load up the key system and go to the **"Key"** tab and and check for **"Check Compatability"** - this is to test if your executor supports Luarmor. If it doesn't you CANNOT use nebora.org!
</Warning>

1. Select a link between 'Linkvertise', 'Work.ink' or 'Lootlabs' by copying it from the discord or the script, after that head on to the website and click on "Start".

2. Finish all required tasks, and then click on **"Get Access"** (Linkvertise).

<Warning>
  During this Step you do not have to download any sketchy Popups, you can just skip them / close them and move on.
