# How to Get A Free Key

<Warning>
  Before starting - load up the key system and go to the "Executors" tab and scroll down until you see "Check Compatability" - this is to test if your executor supports luarmor. If it doesn't you CANNOT use nebora.org!
</Warning>

1. Select a link between 'Linkvertise', 'Work.ink' or 'Lootlabs' by copying it from the discord or the script, after that head on to the website and click on "Start".

2. Finish all required tasks, and then click on "Get Access" (Linkvertise).

<Warning>
  During this step you do NOT have to download anything - if there are any poups JUST CLOSE THEM! - on work.ink you can just skip the download tasks and move on.
